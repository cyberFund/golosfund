This project outlines the basic KPI, upon which, all projects supported by Golos Fund, will be evaluated at the beginning of each month. 

The goal is to automate this process to the maximum. However, it is understandable that some of those KPI's might not be automatically available, and therefore have to be provided by the projects upon request from the Golos Fund team.

The results will be published on the golos.fund/news website and in its blogs: [@golosfund](https://golos.io/@golosfund) and [@golos](https://steemit.com/@golos)

Below are the proposed set of KPI's (in no particular order):

- Number of monthly tx
- Average per 24 hour period
- Number of commits per month
- Number of releases
- Delta between plan and fact in USD terms
- Number of active monthly users
- Number of active weekly users
- Number of active daily users
- % of daily reward pool per day/month
- Change in net balance in % to last month
- Ratio of total balance to expenses
- Ratio of liquid and non liquid balance
- Change in expenses in % to last month
- Amount of participated hackathons
- Amount of participated events
- Ratio of developers to non developers in team
